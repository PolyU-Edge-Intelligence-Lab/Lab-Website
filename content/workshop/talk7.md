# Edge Intelligence and V2X Enabled Autonomous Driving

**Jianping Wang**, Professor  
Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong

![](../k7.png) Prof. Jianping Wang is currently a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong and the assistant provost (Strategic Planning and Quality Assurance). Her research interests are resource allocation and system dependability in Autonomous Driving, V2X, Networking Systems, Edge Computing, and Cloud Computing. Her research has been supported by various funding agencies and industry companies. She has published around 200 papers in prestigious journals and conferences. She has been serving or served on the editorial board of several prestigious IEEE transactions/journals such as IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, IEEE Internet of Things journal. She is recognized in the Top 2% Scientists Worldwide in a study from Stanford University.

**Abstract:** In recent years, autonomous driving has made great progress toward full autonomy enabled by edge intelligence and V2X. In this talk, we will first examine the vulnerabilities of a single autonomous vehicle from hardware, software, environment, and human factors. We will highlight the aspects where edge intelligence and V2X can help individual autonomous vehicles drive safely. We will then present a few edge intelligences and V2X techniques to help achieve full autonomy through cooperative sensing, cooperative driving, cooperative attack detection, and edge computing. At last, we will present a few future research directions.
