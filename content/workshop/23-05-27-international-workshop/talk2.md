**Yuguang (Michael) Fang,** Distinguished Professor, Fellow of AAAS, IEEE

Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida 

![](../k2.jpg)Dr. Yuguang "Michael" Fang received MS degree from Qufu Normal University, Shandong, China in 1987, PhD degree in Systems and Control Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 1994 and PhD degree in Electrical and Computing Engineering from Boston University in 1997. He was an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology from 1998 to 2000. He then joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Florida in 2000 as an assistant professor, then was promoted to an associate professor in 2003 and a full professor in 2005 and has been a distinguished professor since 2019. He holds University of Florida Preeminence Term Professorship (2019-2022), University of Florida Research Foundation (UFRF) Professorship (2006-2009, 2017-2020), and University of Florida Term Professorship (2017-2019, 2019-2021). 

Dr. Fang received the US National Science Foundation Career Award in 2001 and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 2002, 2018 IEEE Vehicular Technology Outstanding Service Award, 2019 Communications Society AHSN Technical Achievement Award, 2015 IEEE Communications Society CISTC Technical Recognition Award, 2014 IEEE Communications Society WTC Recognition Award, and multiple Best Paper Awards from IEEE Globecom (2015, 2011 and 2002) and IEEE ICNP (2006). He has also received the 2019 ECE Faculty Excellence Award in Research, 2010-2011 UF Doctoral Dissertation Advisor/Mentoring Award, and the 2009 UF College of Engineering Faculty Mentoring Award. He served as the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (2013-2017) and IEEE Wireless Communications (2009-2012), and serves/served on several editorial boards of journals including the Proceedings of the IEEE (2018-present), ACM Computing Surveys (2017-present), IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (2003-2008, 2011-2016), IEEE Transactions on Communications (2000-2011), and IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (2002-2009). He has been actively participating in conference organizations such as serving as the Technical Program Co-Chair for IEEE INFOCOM’2014 and the Technical Program Vice-Chair for IEEE INFOCOM'2005. He is the Director of Magazines of IEEE Communications Society and a Distinguished Speaker of IEEE Vehicular Technology. He is a fellow of the IEEE (2008) and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) (2015). 

**Abstract:** Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and/or Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in general have attracted tremendous attention in recent years. They have been shown to be useful not only for traffic management and control, but also for diverse innovative applications to improve people’s quality of life. Observing that the most popular and omnipresent things in any city are vehicles, if each vehicle is equipped with powerful capability in communications, computing, storage, and intelligence (CCSI capability), such vehicles roaming around a city will automatically form a dynamic web of sensing, computing, communications, control, and/or edge intelligence, potentially providing an economically sound alternative solution to realizing the vision of smart city. In this talk, the speaker will discuss how to leverage connected CCSI enabled vehicles to take full advantage of both vehicular mobility and spectrum/computing  opportunity to beef up the edge for various kinds of smart city services.
