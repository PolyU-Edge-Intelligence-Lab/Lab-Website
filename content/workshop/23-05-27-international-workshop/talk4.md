**Abstract:** With the increasing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and rapid advancements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, the integration of AI and IoT, widely referred as AIoT, is gaining momentum. Realizing AIoT will require massive investments in infrastructure, and lessons learned from network deployments point to the use of shared hardware and software resources that can be virtualized to support various services on demand, resulting in AIoT-as-a-Service (AIoTaaS). In this talk, we start with a review of the idea of Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS), leading to IoTaaS and AIaaS, which form the basis of AIoTaaS. We present a framework for AIoTaaS, which incorporates edge and cloud computing platforms to support the AI functionalities required for different services. Enabled by cloud and edge computing, AIoTaaS can effectively implement machine learning (ML) training and inference functions on cloud and edge devices with much less complexity to enable efficient and effective AI decision making in IoT and data analytics, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks. To implement AIoTaaS, interoperability between components at the device level, software level and platform level should be extended while optimizing system and network operations as well as extracting value from data. In the future, AIoTaaS integrated with 5G and blockchain will be leveraged to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions, and enhance data management and analytics, creating a foundation for pervasive AI services and applications.
