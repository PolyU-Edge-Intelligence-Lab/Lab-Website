**Abstract:** Next-generation wireless networks are anticipated to provide connectivity for massive mobile devices and to enable a variety of innovative applications, which also generate enormous computing service demands with diverse and stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), as cutting-edge technology in next-generation networks, can utilize computing resources on the network edge to provide computing services for mobile devices within a radio access network. In this talk, we will investigate computing resource management for MEC, We will introduce two computation offloading and task scheduling schemes tailored for supporting representative use cases and network scenarios in next-generation wireless networks, including the Internet of Vehicles and mobile virtual reality video streaming. Data-model-driven resource management approaches will be exploited to facilitate low-latency and reliable computing services in complex and dynamic network environments.

下一代无线网络将为大量移动设备提供连接，并实现各种创新应用。同时网络内部会产生巨大的计算服务需求，并且这些计算服务具有多样化和严格的服务质量（QoS）要求。为了支持这些新兴的计算需求，移动边缘计算（MEC）作为下一代网络的尖端技术，利用网络边缘的计算资源，实现在无线接入网络内为移动设备提供低延迟的计算服务。在本次演讲中，我们将探讨MEC的计算资源管理，以满足网络中多样的计算需求。我们将介绍两种计算卸载和任务调度方案，分别针对两种下一代无线网络中的代表性用例和网络场景：车联网和移动虚拟现实视频流。在这两种方案中，我们探索了数据模型双驱动的资源管理方法，在复杂和动态的无线网络环境中实现低延迟和可靠的计算服务。
