## Background

In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, real-world learning often requires robot trajectory rollouts for model evaluation, data collection, and reinforcement learning. However, these rollouts can be time-consuming and demand intensive human supervision to ensure safety. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach: developing a **robot action simulator**. This simulator can accurately emulate robot rollouts in a virtual environment, providing faster, safer, and more efficient evaluation of robot trajectories. Moreover, it can serve as a world model for planning robot actions, helping robots simulate and select optimal trajectories.


## Contributions
In this project, we present a groundbreaking action-to-video generation method, \ourmethod, which predicts a video of a robot executing a sequence of actions given the initial frame and action sequence. Our work focuses on robot arms completing manipulation tasks, leveraging the cutting-edge generative capabilities of Diffusion Transformer technology. 
1. **Novel Action-to-Video Generation Task:** We introduce a task that predicts videos of robots performing a sequence of actions based on an initial frame and the action sequence.
2. **Innovative Method:** We develop a novel method based on Diffusion Transformer, capable of generating accurate and realistic videos that strictly follow the input action sequence.
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** We validate the effectiveness of RASthrough extensive experiments on three real-robot manipulation datasets: Language-Table, RT-1, and Bridge.


## Significance

The proposed RAS revolutionizes robot learning by providing a safer, faster, and more effective evaluation framework for robot trajectories. By accurately simulating interactions with objects in the environment, it enables significant advancements in real-world robot learning and manipulation tasks. Furthermore, RAS has the potential to transform various robotics applications, from industrial automation to assistive robotics, accelerating the development of intelligent and autonomous robots worldwide.
