<!-- ### **1. Heterogeneous Data & Resource Constraints: Batch Size Adaptation** -->
In our pursuit of building open, intelligent, and efficient AI large models, we prioritize addressing the challenges posed by diverse data and resources distributed across edge endpoints. Our overarching goal is to meet the multifaceted demands associated with large model training, fine-tuning, inference, and deployment while optimizing the model construction process through intelligent methods to enhance overall performance.

To achieve this goal, we focus on several key aspects. Firstly, we emphasize the development of open frameworks and platforms that facilitate seamless collaboration and knowledge sharing within the AI community. By fostering an open ecosystem, we aim to accelerate innovation and enable researchers and practitioners to collectively push the boundaries of AI large models.

Secondly, we recognize the importance of intelligence in the construction and utilization of these models. By incorporating intelligent techniques such as automated architecture search, model compression, and efficient resource allocation, we aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of large model development and deployment. This involves leveraging machine learning algorithms, optimization strategies, and adaptive methodologies to tailor models to specific tasks and resource constraints.

Furthermore, we are committed to driving the widespread adoption of AI large models in vertical application scenarios. By actively engaging with industry partners and domain experts, we seek to facilitate deep technology integration, enabling AI models to seamlessly integrate into various domains such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and more. Through such integration, we aim to unlock the full potential of AI in solving complex real-world problems and creating maximum value for diverse industries.

In summary, our focus lies in building open, intelligent, and efficient AI large models that cater to the diverse data and resources distributed across edge endpoints. By pursuing advancements in technology, fostering collaboration, and driving adoption in vertical application scenarios, we aim to pave the way for transformative breakthroughs and maximize the value created by AI large models.
