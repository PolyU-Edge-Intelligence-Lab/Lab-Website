<!-- ### **1. Heterogeneous Data & Resource Constraints: Batch Size Adaptation** -->
The unprecedented impact of foundation model technology, represented by ChatGPT, is driving a revolutionary paradigm shift in AI, bringing new opportunities and challenges to many industries. However, the high training, inference and maintenance costs of foundation model technologies limit their widespread adoption. Considering that edge computing power (e.g., edge servers, personal PCs, etc.), which accounts for about 90% of the network, has not yet been effectively used, we focus on a new federated edge AI cyberinfrastructure, and leverages the natural advantages of edge computing power in terms of cost, latency, and privacy, so as to efficiently aggregate the distributed, heterogeneous, and multi-party computing power and become an important computing power supplier in the computing power network, and promote the foundation model technology-based intelligent upgrading of various industries.
