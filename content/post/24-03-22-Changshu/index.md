Congratulations to Dr. Xu for being named as one of the "2023 Changshu Kuncheng Lake Â· Hurun China Under30s" - a list of China's top young entrepreneurs under the age of 31. This year, a total of 189 young talents from 183 companies in 22 industries made the list, with an average age of 28, and a male-to-female ratio of 77:23. Dr. Xu's company, which has been in operation for 4.7 years, has 180 employees and has raised a total of RMB 39 million in funding up to Series A. Of the companies on the list, 49% sell physical products while 51% sell software or services, with 51% being B2B and 49% being B2C. This list is in line with the Chinese government's policy of promoting emerging and future industries, encouraging venture capital and equity investment, and optimizing the function of industrial investment funds. With over 11.7 million college graduates expected this year, it is important to strengthen policies and measures to promote youth employment and entrepreneurship. We wish Dr. Xu and all the other young talents on the list continued success in their entrepreneurial endeavors, and hope they will contribute to the high-quality development of the Chinese economy.
