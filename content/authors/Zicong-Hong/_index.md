Zicong Hong is pursuing his Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computing at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (香港理工大学), Hong Kong SAR, China, supervised by Prof. Song Guo, Fellow of IEEE. Before that, in 2020, he received B.E. degree in software engineering from Sun Yat-sen University (中山大学), Guangzhou, China, supervised by Prof. Wuhui Chen in InplusLab.

His research interest broadly lies in the areas of blockchain, edge computing and incentive mechanism. Some specific topics such as sharding, payment channel, multi-hop computation offloading, and incentive for federated learning are highly involved. He is the recipient of the Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship (2020).
