Jingcai Guo is currently a research assistant professor with the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He obtained his PhD, MEng, and BEng from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Waseda University, and Sichuan University, repectively, all in computer science and AI. He is generally interested in Edge AI and resource-ffficient computing, which target learning/modeling with limited resources in terms of data, computing capability, as well as exploring their derivative applications on wide spectrums. Some specific topics include zero/few-shot learning, federated learning, representation learning, model compression, and lightweight solutions for foundation/large models. He is currently serving as Associate Editor for IEEE Open Journal of the Computer Society and Guest Editor for IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems. He regularly serves as Area Chair / Senior PC for prestigious conferences like ICML, AAAI, IJCAI, and ACM-MM. He has been the Publicity Chair for SRDS 2022 and Track Chair for VTC 2024 Fall. He is the reviewer for the General Program and the Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. He was the recipient of the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship in 2017.
